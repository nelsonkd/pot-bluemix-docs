## 7.1 - Customize the Developer Portal

In this section, you will leverage a custom prebuilt theme. A theme file is packaged as a zip file that contains a set of predefined files. The theme zip file is what is loaded into the developer portal. The best method for creating a custom theme is to obtain an existing custom theme, rename it and change the files as explained in the table below to meet your customization needs.

|Filename|Description|
|--------|-----------|  
|`overrides.css`|This style sheet overrides the fonts, colors and other defaults from the inherited base IBM API Connect theme. The name of this css file is specified in the theme.info file.|
|`screenshot.png`|The file contains a screenshot of the home page for the custom theme and is used in the appearance settings so you can easily find the theme you want to enable and set as the default theme. When you are finishing completing the edits to the overrides.css and have set up the welcome banner to your satisfaction, you should take a screen shot of the developer portal home page and capture it with Snagit or some other screen capture tool and place the file in the top level directory of the theme file. The name of this screenshot file is specified in the theme.info file.|
|`templete.php`|The template.php file contains your sub-theme's functions to manipulate Drupal's default markup. It is one of the most useful files when creating or modifying Drupal themes. With this file you can modify any theme hooks variables or add your own variables, using preprocess or process functions. Override any theme function: that is, replace a module's default theme function with one you write. Call hook alter functions, which allow you to alter various parts of Drupal's internals, including the render elements in forms. See <http://api.drupal.org> for more information about these functions.| 
|`thinkibm_connect_theme.info`|The .info file is a static text file for defining and configuring a theme. Each line in the.info file is a key-value pair with the key on the left and the value on the right, with an "equals sign" between them (e.g. name = my_theme). The info file naming conventions needs to have the theme name specified as part of the filename. The project key in the .info file contains the name of the theme.|
|`theme-settings.php`|Drupal themes get a number of configurable settings options for free. For example, most provide toggle switches for the search box, site slogans, user pictures, and so on. Similarly, most provide file uploading widgets to add a custom logo or favicon. These settings are easy: Drupal will add them to the theme's configuration page by default, so it takes no extra work. We want to create our own custom setting, however; one that adds a hidden field that contains the current release information to the Theme configuration form. To do that, we'll need to add a new file to the theme: `theme-settings.php`. The function name specified within this file needs to be prefixed with the theme name: `thinkibm_connect_theme`.|
|`thinkibm_welcome_banner.png`|This file provides the image that shows up in the welcome banner. Although the welcome banner does not need to be part of the theme zip file contents, it is useful to place the welcome banner with other theme files.|
|`favicon.ico`|In web development, you can provide a small logo for your site that appears near the address bar and in the bookmarks folder in a visitor's browser. This logo is called the favicon. Drupal provides a default one, which is the recognizable water drop logo. Using the Drupal logo as the favicon is fine but if you really want to make your site stand out, you should provide your own. Favicon files are in the .ico format and are extremely small in dimensions. The default Drupal favicon is 32 pixels high by 32 pixels wide, many browsers use a 16 x 16 pixel version that can be included in the same file. This is because the favicon is only an icon that shows up in the address bar and favorites (bookmarks) list and typically there is not a lot of room there. Any favicon that you create should be just as small.|

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/close-region-block.png)

1. You are finished with customizing the developer portal. There is a lot more that can be customized than what we have time for in this lab. Log out of the developer portal.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/PortalAdminLogout.png)

## 7.2 - Register an Application as a Developer 

In this section, you will log into the portal as a user in the application developer role, then register an application that will be used to consume APIs. If you have not created your developer account from Lab 1, you will need to use the `Create an account` link to do so now.

1. Login into the developer portal as an application developer using your developer credentials.

1. Click the `Apps` link, then click on the `Register new Application` link.

1. Enter a title and description for the application and click the `Submit` button.

	> Title: `ThinkIBM Consumer`
	>
	> Description: `Test Application for ThinkIBM APIs`
	>
	> OAuth Redirect URI: `< leave blank >`

1. We need to capture the Client Secret and Client ID in a text editor for later use by our test application. Select the `Show Client Secret` checkbox next to Client Secret at the top of the page and the `Show` checkbox next to Client ID.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/ShowClientSecretandID.png)

1. Open your favorite text editor and copy/paste both the Client ID and Client Secret to your editor. Add a notation above each item so you know which value is the Client ID and which is the Client Secret.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/SaveClientIDandSecret.png)

## 7.3 - Subscribe to a Plan for the ThinkIBM APIs 
In this section, we will subscribe to a plan for the ThinkIBM APIs using the ThinkIBM Consumer application.

1. Click the `API Products` link.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/PortalAPIProductsList.png)

1. Click the `think (v1.0.0)` API product link.

1. You will be directed to the Product page which lists the available plans for subscription.

	Click on the `Subscribe` button under the `Silver` plan.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/SubscribetoThinkSilverPlan.png)
	
	> ![Alt text][info]
	> 
	> The Gold plan requires approval by the API provider for any subscription requests and allows unlimited requests for a given time period. The Silver plan is limited to 100 requests per hour and does not require approval by the API provider for subscription requests.    

1. Select the `Think IBM Web Consumer` toggle and click the `Subscribe` button.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/subscribe-to-plan.png)

1. The `Think IBM Web Consumer` Web application is now subscribed to the Silver plan for the `think` API product.

## 7.4 - Test `think` Product APIs from the Developer Portal

In this section, we will use the developer portal to test one of the think product APIs. This is useful for application developers to **_try out_** the APIs before their application is fully developed or to simply see the expected response based on inputs they provide the API. Later in this lab, you will run an actual application that is already developed and uses these same APIs. We will test the `logistics` API from the developer portal.

1. Click the `logistics` link on the left-hand navigation menu and then expand the `GET /shipping` path by clicking on the twisty next to the path.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/PortalExpandShipping.png)

1. Scroll down to the **Try this operation** section for the `GET /shipping` path. Enter any zip code and click the `Call Operation` button.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/PortalTryShippingOperation.png)

1. Scoll down below the `Call operation` button. You should see a `200 OK` and a response body as shown below.
  
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/PortalTryShippingOperationResultsSuccess.png)

## 7.5 - Test the APIs from the Think IBM Web Consumer Application

Now that you have browsed the API Portal and registered / tested the API's that **ThinkIBM** is providing, it's time to test them out from a real application. We have provided a sample consumer application which will be used to interract with the **ThinkIBM** API's.

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to:

	[https://thinkibm-consumer.mybluemix.net](https://thinkibm-consumer.mybluemix.net)

1. In order to set up the consumer app to use your registered client credentials, a setup screen will be displayed asking for some application configuration parameters.

1. Using the Client ID and Client Secret values you saved earlier in your text editor, copy/paste them into the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields as shown below:

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/consumer-app-config-creds.png)

1. You will also need to enter the API Connect Host, Organization and Catalog values. The easiest way to find these is to return to the API Manager on Bluemix and browse the Catalog Endpoint Settings as shown below:

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/consumer-app-config-host.png)

1. Click the `Submit` button to complete the application configuration. The test application saves your settings in browser session variables.

1. The home page is a simple landing page which does not invoke any of the API's. Recall that in **Lab 4** you secured the `inventory` API by requiring an OAuth token. If you attempt to view the Item Inventory before logging in, you will be challenged for a username and password. Either click on the `Browse Item Inventory` button, or the `Log In` link to open the login prompt.

1. Enter any Username and Password then click the `Log In` button. Our sample authentication service is a dummy repository that will accept any credentials provided.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/enter-oauth-creds.png)

	> ![][info]
	> 
	> The consumer app will contact our OAuth Token URL and handle the token exchange using standard OAuth proceedures. If you're interested in seeing the token, you can open your browser's developer tools and view the Console logs and Network trace
	>
	> ![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/consumer-app-console.png)

1. Once you are logged in, the consumer application will redirect you to the item inventory page. The data displayed on the page is being powered by our `inventory` API! The consumer application is calling to our API, which is then being sent to our LoopBack application which handles the connection to the Cloudant data source where the inventory item data is persisted.

1. Click around the pages. Use the review form to leave new reviews for items. Recall how the item reviews are separate data models stored in a different data source, yet are related to the items through our LoopBack application.

	Notice how the product rating is updated automatically as new reviews are posted. This happens because of the custom code you added to the LoopBack application in **Lab 3**.
	
	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/customer-reviews.png)

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/updated-rating.png)

1. Continue testing the features of the consumer application. Try entering your home zip code to obtain shipping data. This feature is powered by the `logistics` APIs that were built using advanced assembly techniques in Lab 5. Your quotes will vary based on the zip code provided.

	Notice how you are also provided a link to the nearest store. Clicking here will launch the Google Maps link which was also built in our Lab 5 assembly.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/shipping-results.png)

1. Finally, try clicking on the `Calculate Monthly Payment` link. This feature is powered by the `financing` API that was created using our REST-to-SOAP assembly in Lab 5.

	![](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/pot-bluemix-docs/raw/5030/img/lab7/financing-results.png)

1. Repeat the steps on a few of products to drive data into the analytics database.
